Vitero Activity Plugin for Moodle 3.5

==Features==

This plugin provides integration between Moodle and a Vitero (Virtual Team Room) server. A Moodle site is linked to a
single Vitero account.

When added to a course, a session will be created on the Vitero server. The course users will be given a direct link to
the Vitero conference room at its scheduled time. The student details and role will be synchronised to Vitero. The
course administrator will have the choice of rooms (based on availability for the given account).

The module will also update or delete the Vitero session details if done so in Moodle.


==Installation==

1. Unzip the files locally, and upload them to a folder called 'mod/vitero' on the server.
2. Login as admin and visit the home page to trigger the upgrade
3. Set the Vitero server and account details
4. Save and return to the settings menu to test connection
